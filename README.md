My name is Daniel and I have a background in electronic and new media. I have some experience with HTML and CSS and a small bit of knowledge developing with JavaScript. Back when Flash was still a thing, I learned ActionScript3 and developed a handful of projects, including games and interactive websites.

My ultimate goal is to be able to design and develop applications to solve problems in my own life, and hope they will also be useful for others with similar issues.
